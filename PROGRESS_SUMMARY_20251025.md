## 🎉 Major Milestone Achieved: AudioSocket Format Bug Fixed & Validated

### What Was Accomplished Today

1. **Identified Critical Bug** (RCA `rca-20251025-062235`)
   - AudioSocket wire format incorrectly overridden by caller's SIP codec
   - Line 1862 in `src/engine.py`: `spm.audiosocket_format = enc` (from transport profile)
   - Impact: μ-law frames (160 bytes) sent when PCM16 frames (320 bytes) expected → garble

2. **Implemented Fix** (Commit `1a049ce`)
   - Removed AudioSocket format override from transport profile detection
   - AudioSocket format now always sourced from YAML `audiosocket.format` config
   - Transport profile now only governs provider transcoding, not wire format

3. **Deployed to Production**
   - Committed and pushed fix
   - Rebuilt and force-recreated `ai_engine` container on server
   - Verified alignment logs show correct `audiosocket_format: "slin"`

4. **Validated with Test Call** (Call ID `1761424308.2043`)
   - Duration: 45 seconds
   - Result: ✅ **"Clean audio, clean two-way conversation. Audio pipeline is working really well."** (User quote)
   - All metrics match golden baseline

5. **Documented** (Commit `a326b1e`)
   - Added bug fix section to `docs/plan/ROADMAPv4.md`
   - Created comprehensive RCA analysis: `logs/remote/rca-20251025-203447/SUCCESS_RCA_ANALYSIS.md`
   - Saved memory for future reference

## Minor Issues Identified (Non-Critical)

### 1. Low-Buffer Backoff Cycling
- **What**: Adaptive backoff events during silence (streaks 1-5)
- **Why**: Normal behavior when provider pauses between responses
- **Impact**: None - prevents wasteful filler injection
- **Action**: Monitor; working as designed

### 2. Provider Grace Period Capped
- **What**: Config `provider_grace_ms: 500` capped internally to 60ms
- **Why**: Code applies conservative cap for some operations
- **Impact**: Minor - may limit tail-end cleanup window
- **Priority**: Low - did not affect call quality
- **Action**: Review cap logic if continuous_stream cleanup needs tuning

### 3. Low Audio Energy Warning
- **What**: Single frame (RMS 189 vs threshold 200) at greeting start
- **Why**: Attack envelope or initial silence
- **Impact**: None - transient, overall RMS healthy (2557 avg)
- **Action**: None required

### 4. Offline Vosk Transcription Limited
- **What**: Engine's offline Vosk can't transcribe caller 8 kHz audio
- **Why**: Model `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15` may not handle 8 kHz telephony well
- **Impact**: None - Deepgram live STT works perfectly
- **Action**: Consider upgrading Vosk model for better RCA diagnostics

## Production Readiness Assessment

### ✅ System Status: **PRODUCTION READY**

**Checklist**:
- ✅ AudioSocket wire format stable (`slin` enforced from YAML)
- ✅ Provider transcoding working (μ-law ↔ PCM16)
- ✅ Frame pacing correct (320 bytes @ 20ms)
- ✅ Byte accounting perfect (ratio 1.0)
- ✅ Audio quality excellent (SNR > 64 dB)
- ✅ Continuous stream mode operational
- ✅ Two-way conversation confirmed by user
- ✅ Golden baseline metrics achieved
- ⚠️ Minor tuning opportunities exist (non-blocking)

**Recommendation**: System is production-ready. Minor tuning can be done incrementally in future iterations.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Complete)
- ✅ Fix AudioSocket format override bug
- ✅ Deploy and validate
- ✅ Document in ROADMAPv4
- ✅ Create success RCA
- ✅ Save memory

### Near-Term (Optional Tuning)
1. **Monitor Low-Buffer Backoff Behavior**
   - Observe in additional calls
   - Consider adjusting `empty_backoff_ticks_max` if needed

2. **Review Provider Grace Cap**
   - Investigate 60ms internal cap
   - Determine if 500ms config should be honored for continuous_stream

3. **Upgrade Diagnostic Vosk Model**
   - Test `vosk-model-en-us-0.22` or similar
   - Improves offline RCA transcription quality

### Roadmap Progression
**Current Status**: Pre-P0 Critical Bug Fixed ✅

**Next Milestone**: P0 - Transport Stabilization & Endianness
- Remove/simplify egress swap logic (currently set to `auto`)
- Establish AudioSocket as single source of truth for wire format
- Implement regression test suite
- Per ROADMAPv4 plan

**Timeline**: Ready to begin P0 work

## Key Learnings

### 1. Architecture Clarity
**AudioSocket wire leg is SEPARATE from caller trunk codec**:
- Caller trunk: μ-law (SIP codec negotiation)
- AudioSocket wire: PCM16 slin (static per YAML/dialplan)
- Transport profile: Governs provider transcoding only
- Never mix caller codec with AudioSocket wire format

### 2. Transport Profile Purpose
- **Purpose**: Provider transcoding alignment (caller ↔ provider)
- **NOT for**: AudioSocket wire format (that's from YAML config)
- **Example**: Caller μ-law → Deepgram μ-law (no transcode), but AudioSocket wire is still PCM16

### 3. Golden Baseline Value
- Having a documented golden baseline with metrics was critical
- Enabled precise comparison and fast validation
- Should be maintained for regression testing

### 4. RCA Process Works
- `scripts/rca_collect.sh` captured all needed artifacts
- Comprehensive analysis possible with logs + audio + metrics
- Process should be repeated for each major change
